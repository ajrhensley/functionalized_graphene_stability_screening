## Article Abstract
Functionalized graphene has numerous applications, including in catalysis, environmental pollutant removal, advanced energy storage, electronic devices, and sensing devices, due to their remarkable and tunable physicochemical properties. However, the precise control of functionalization remains challenging as direct connections between the stability of a wide range of defects and functional groups on graphene as a function of treatment condition is missing. Here, we perform a systematic study of the functionalization of graphene with hydrogen and oxygen using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio phase diagrams. The interplay between carbon defects (i.e. vacancies, Stone-Wales, 555-777, etc.) and functionalization (i.e. R-H, R-H<sub>2</sub>, R-O, R-OH, and R-COOH) is examined. Furthermore, we consider the effect of functional group concentration and configuration. In general, the process of functionalizing graphene structures with dangling carbon bonds, such as carbon vacancies, led to significantly more stable carbon defects, except for R-COOH. By calculating Gibbs free formation energies across various temperatures and partial pressures of H<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, we were able to construct ab initio phase diagrams. These diagrams revealed that depending on the balance between the applied hydrogen and oxygen chemical potentials during treatment, six distinct structures prevail: R-H, R-O, R-OH, and R-COOH on the basal plane of graphene; and R-O and R-H<sub>2</sub> on graphene with a double carbon vacancy. Through this systematic study, we not only pinpoint treatment conditions conducive to the formation of specific functional groups on graphene but also identify both stable and metastable graphene-based configurations that have potential applications across various fields.
